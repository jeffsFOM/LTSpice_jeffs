# LTSpice_jeffs
Repo for holding various simulations and supporting files for LTSpice

There's only a few things here, I'm mainly interested in power supply design
so mostly that's what you'll see, although the first thing I've posted is a
simulation model for a brushed DC motor.  That was driven by needs for a
project so was the first to get tuned up.  See my blog at www.fomsystems.com
for information about these models.
